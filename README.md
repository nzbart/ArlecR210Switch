# The protocol

The chip in the remote doesn't have any markings at all.

There don't appear to be any individual serial numbers on the sockets. It appears that the remote conrol is pre-programmed with 4 different fixed codes, and the individual sockets can be paired with any of those codes by pressing the button on the remote when the socket is powered on.

My particular remote control has the following 4 codes (the 32 data bits + the 1st sync bit are shown) to turn the switches on, in addition to one that turns all switches on:

* A:   011101101101100000001111100111100
* B:   011101101101100000001101100111000
* C:   011101101101100000001011100110100
* D:   011101101101100000000111100101100
* All: 011101101101100000000100100101010

To turn the switches off, the 23rd (base 0) bit is set to 0 and the 31st bit is set to 1.

For example, to turn D on or off:

```
* On:  011101101101100000000111100101100
* Off: 011101101101100000000110100101110
                              ^       ^
```

A pattern emerges if you break the bit stream up:
```
A: 01110110110110000000 111 1 1001 111 0 0
B: 01110110110110000000 110 1 1001 110 0 0
C: 01110110110110000000 101 1 1001 101 0 0
D: 01110110110110000000 011 1 1001 011 0 0
*: 01110110110110000000 010 1 1001 010 0 0
```
The first part is identical for all. The next three bits appear to identify the switch. The following bit is on/off. The next block is always 1001. The block after that appears to be the switch identifier repeated. Then follows the inverse of the on/off switch bit, and another zero.
